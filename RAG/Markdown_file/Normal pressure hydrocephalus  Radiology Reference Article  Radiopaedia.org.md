**Normal pressure hydrocephalus** remains a controversial entity with often ambiguous imaging findings. It is classically characterised by the triad of gait apraxia/ataxia, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment, although not all patients with the condition have all three <sup>31</sup>.

On imaging, it can be characterised both on CT and MRI by enlarged lateral and third ventricles out of proportion to the cortical sulcal enlargement, associated with Sylvian fissure widening and crowding at the vertex. This pattern has been termed [disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/disproportionately-enlarged-subarachnoid-space-hydrocephalus-desh) and is helpful in distinguishing normal pressure hydrocephalus from other causes of hydrocephalus.

This article is focused on idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). For a discussion of secondary causes of communicating hydrocephalus, please refer to the article [hydrocephalus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hydrocephalus).

#### Terminology

It is important to note that there are many causes of communicating hydrocephalus without elevated opening [CSF](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebrospinal-fluid-1) pressures, such as [trauma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/traumatic-brain-injury), prior [subarachnoid haemorrhage](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subarachnoid-haemorrhage), and [meningitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/leptomeningitis). This is sometimes confusingly referred to as secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus <sup>3</sup>. Most clinicians will assume that one is referring to idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus if no qualifier is used.

#### Epidemiology

The incidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus is much higher in elderly populations. Exact epidemiology is difficult to establish, as the diagnosis is often not made in nursing home patients as 

-   20% of patients in nursing homes have gait impairment
    
-   10% of these patients also have dementia
    
-   15% have incontinence <sup>19</sup>
    

but the prevalence is estimated at ~1.5% (range 0.1-2.9%) <sup>35</sup>.

A large study in Norway found a striking increase in incidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus with increasing age from 3.3 per 100,000 people (50-59 years) to 181.7 per 100,000 people (70-79 years) <sup>3</sup>.

#### Clinical presentation

The classical clinical findings of normal pressure hydrocephalus are <sup>1-3</sup>:

-   urinary incontinence
    
-   congnitive impairment (ranging from mild to severe, i.e. dementia)
    
-   gait disturbances
    
    -   a classic neurological sign in normal pressure hydrocephalus is magnetic gait, where the patient's feet appear to be magnetically attached to the floor
        

These can be remembered with the unkind mnemonic [wet, wacky, and wobbly](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/normal-pressure-hydrocephalus-mnenomic). 

As the name suggests, mean CSF opening pressure is within the normal range (<18 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or 13 mmHg) <sup>3</sup>.

#### Pathology

The underlying cause remains controversial and there are many theories. One theory is that the condition is an obstructive type of [communicating hydrocephalus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/communicating-hydrocephalus) due to reduced CSF resorption.

Another theory suggests it results from weakening of the ventricular wall due to [periventricular white matter ischaemic damage](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebral-small-vessel-disease) <sup>3</sup>. The periventricular white matter ischaemic change has also been hypothesised to slow the flow of CSF through the extracellular spaces, resulting in a "back-pressure" effect, leading to ventricular enlargement.

A further theory, based on studies of CSF flow, propose an abnormal communication between the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle and the ambient cistern via the choroidal fissure as being contributory <sup>38</sup>.

Regardless of the aetiological basis, the result is that shearing forces are exerted on the periventricular white matter as the ventricles enlarge. As the [corticospinal tracts](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/anterior-corticospinal-tract) to the legs run medially, these tangential shearing forces cause gait disturbance.

#### Radiographic features

##### CT

Although CT is able to visualise the anatomical changes, it is inferior to MRI. 

##### MRI

MRI is the best modality to image anatomical changes and can further support the diagnosis with [CSF flow studies](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/csf-flow-studies) and [magnetic resonance spectroscopy](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mr-spectroscopy-1).

###### Morphological changes

-   [ventriculomegaly](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ventriculomegaly-1)
    
    -   increased [Evans index](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/evans-index-2) >0.3 <sup>1,2,24,25</sup>
        
    -   increased [ALVI](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/anteroposterior-diameter-of-the-lateral-ventricle-index-1 "Anteroposterior diameter of the lateral ventricle index (ALVI)") >0.5 <sup>34</sup>
        
    -   widening of the temporal horns of the [lateral ventricles](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/lateral-ventricle-1) >6 mm not accounted for by hippocampal atrophy <sup>2,25</sup>
        
    -   acute [callosal angle](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/callosal-angle) (less than 90 degrees) <sup>1,24-27</sup>
        
    -   upward bowing of the [corpus callosum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/corpus-callosum) <sup>3,14</sup>
        
-   disproportionate changes in subarachnoid spaces
    
    -   dilated [Sylvian fissures](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sylvian-fissure) and [insular cisterns](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sylvian-cistern "Insular cistern") <sup>2,24,25,28</sup>
        
    -   effacement of the sulci and subarachnoid spaces at the vertex and medial/parafalcine region <sup>1,24,25,28</sup>
        
    -   [cingulate sulcus sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cingulate-sulcus-sign): posterior half of cingulate sulcus is narrower than the anterior half <sup>1,17</sup>
        
    -   focal/isolated dilation of individual sulci over the medial surface or convexity (sometimes called transport sulci) <sup>1,24,28,29</sup>
        

The combination of ventriculomegaly, Sylvian fissure and insular cistern widening, and crowding at the vertex has been termed [disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/disproportionately-enlarged-subarachnoid-space-hydrocephalus-desh), reflecting disproportionality between the superior and inferior CSF spaces <sup>1,23,27</sup>. The finding of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus without neurologic symptoms has been termed [asymptomatic ventriculomegaly with features of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus on MRI (AVIM)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/disproportionately-enlarged-subarachnoid-space-hydrocephalus-desh) <sup>1</sup>. It is felt by some authors that AVIM is actually a pre-clinical form of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus <sup>30</sup>. 

###### Brain composition changes

Periventricular hypodensity (on CT) or high T2-FLAIR signal (on MRI) is supportive of changes in brain water content seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus, and is sometimes referred to as [transependymal oedema](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/transependymal-edema-1 "Transependymal oedema"). It is worth noting, however, that these findings can be difficult to distinguish from [microvascular ischaemic changes](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebral-small-vessel-disease "Chronic small vessel disease") and that, in fact, they may co-exist <sup>2,25,35,26</sup>.

###### CSF flow changes

Although prominent aqueductal flow void due to increased CSF velocity across the aqueduct is often seen in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus - best seen on T2 and PD spin-echo sequences <sup>14</sup> - it is no longer considered a useful sign, as in modern higher field strength MRI machines aqueductal CSF flow void is present in most of the normal subjects. Additionally, it is highly sequence-specific. 

There is, however, a well-established correlation between higher flow velocities and the favourable outcome after ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting; hence, quantitative (rather than qualitative) methods have been developed which can be useful not only in patient selection for shunting but also in diagnosis and predicting prognosis <sup>12-15</sup>

-   [CSF flow studies](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/csf-flow-studies) <sup>3</sup>
    
    -   increased aqueductal CSF stroke volume
        
        -   aqueductal CSF stroke volume is the average volume of CSF flowing through the cerebral aqueduct during both systole and diastole
            
    -   increased aqueductal peak velocity
        
    -   various publications have set various normal and abnormal ranges
        
        -   flow rate of >24.5 mL/min 95% specific for normal pressure hydrocephalus <sup>9,11</sup>
            
        -   stroke volume of ≥42 μL shown in one paper to predict a good response to shunting in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus <sup>10</sup>, however, one study has cast serious doubt on the usefulness of aqueduct stroke volume in patient selection for VP shunting <sup>21</sup>
            
        -   stroke volume upper limit is now suggested to be variable between institutions due to intrinsic scanner differences; thus each centre should obtain their own "normal values", with the upper limit being suggested as two times the normal value <sup>16</sup>
            
    -   studies have shown that aqueductal stroke volume decreases later in the disease process despite clinical progression
        
        -   this has been theorised to be caused by cerebral atrophy, which indicates that the patient is unlikely to respond to shunt surgery <sup>18</sup>
            

###### MR spectroscopy

MR spectroscopy has not been shown to have any added value for differentiating idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus from other types of dementia, nor does it help in patient selection for VP shunting <sup>22</sup>.

##### Nuclear medicine

Nuclear medicine is less important in diagnosing normal pressure hydrocephalus. Some of the features described are <sup>13</sup>:

-   early detection of the radiotracer into lateral ventricles giving a heart-shaped appearance of lateral ventricles rather than a normal trident pattern
    
-   persistence of radiopharmaceutical beyond 24-48 hours due to impaired absorption
    
-   radiotracer does not extend to the superior aspect of convexities of lateral ventricles
    
-   retrograde CSF flow into lateral ventricles
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus, once the diagnosis is established, is with CSF shunting, usually a [ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP shunt)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ventriculoperitoneal-shunt). The challenge is identifying those patients who will benefit from shunting. Favourable prognostic factors include <sup>3</sup>:

-   short duration of presurgical symptoms (less than 6 months)
    
-   onset of gait disturbance before cognitive impairment
    
-   temporary symptom relief from a CSF tap test (removal of 40 mL of CSF via lumbar puncture)
    
-   absence of significant cerebral vascular disease
    
-   presence of an aqueductal flow void on T2 imaging <sup>10,14</sup>
    

When patients are selected on the basis of clinical and imaging features, 80% response favourably to CSF diversion <sup>33</sup>.

#### History and etymology

It is thought to have been initially described by Colombian neurosurgeon **Salomón Hakim** and **R D Adams** in 1965, although it may actually have been described earlier under a different name by **McHugh** <sup>4,6,7</sup>.

#### Differential diagnosis

Clinical differential diagnosis includes [vascular dementia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vascular-dementia "Vascular dementia") and atypical parkinsonian disorders, e.g. [progressive supranuclear palsy](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-1 "Progressive supranuclear palsy") and [multiple system atrophy - Parkinsonian type (MSA-P)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=Multiple+system+atrophy+-+Parkinsonian+type+%28MSA-P%29 "Multiple system atrophy - Parkinsonian type (MSA-P)") <sup>32</sup>.

The possible imaging differential spectrum includes:

-   normal ageing brain
    
-   [Alzheimer dementia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/alzheimer-disease): may show greater dilatation of perihippocampal fissures <sup>2</sup>
    
-   [obstructive hydrocephalus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/obstructive-hydrocephalus)
    
    -   due to mass lesion (e.g. pineal region, tectal plate, midbrain)
        
    -   due to [aqueductal stenosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/aqueduct-stenosis "Aqueductal stenosis")
        
-   [Lewy body dementia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dementia-with-lewy-bodies): visual hallucinations and delusions are more prominent
    
-   [Parkinson disease](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/parkinson-disease-1): unilateral symptoms are important
