## Citation, DOI, disclosures and article data

**Fetal hydrocephalus** often refers to an extension of [fetal ventriculomegaly](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fetal-ventriculomegaly) where the ventricular dilatation is more severe. It is usually defined when the fetal lateral ventricular diameter is >15 mm <sup>1</sup>.

#### Epidemiology

The estimated incidence is 0.5-3 cases per 1000 live births. There may be a very slight increased female predilection <sup>11</sup>.

#### Pathology

Fetal hydrocephalus can be either obstructive or non-obstructive and each can arise from a number of aetiologies. In a small proportion of cases, it carries a familial X-linked inheritance ([congenital X-linked hydrocephalus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=congenital-x-linked-hydrocephalus)).

##### Causes

-   [in utero infection(s)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/in-utero-infection)
    

##### Associations

The vast majority of conditions are associated with other intracranial and cranial anomalies <sup>6</sup>. The list includes:

-   **central nervous system anomalies**: (more common <sup>7</sup> and reported in >80% of cases)
    
    -   [aqueductal stenosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/aqueduct-stenosis): one of the most common causative associations

#### Radiographic features

##### Ultrasound

Will demonstrate enlarged ventricles with variable degrees of parenchymal thinning. The [choroid](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/choroid-plexus "Choroid plexus") may be seen floating within the ventricle giving a [dangling choroid sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=dangling-choroid-sign). Often a separation of more than 3 mm between the choroid plexus and the margin of the ventricle is considered abnormal <sup>ref</sup>. In some cases, there may also be evidence of [macrocephaly](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/macrocephaly) <sup>ref</sup>.

#### Treatment and prognosis

The overall prognosis will depend on the underlying cause and associated anomalies. Some cases can slowly progress during the fetal period. Antenatal shunting has been considered in a small proportion of selected cases <sup>2</sup>.
